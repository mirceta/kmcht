[Contributing]
- GitHub flow: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

- Distributing work:
We make projects, which contain GitHub issues.
- Main Project
- One project for each major feature

Project workflow:
  1. Research: Discussion of ideas, what can be done, where are the limits,
               what are we going to use, Explore options, what are pluses, minuses,
               Donâ€™t go into details yet. Here we explore options.
  2. Spec: plan of implementation. (Motivation, what are we trying to achieve, details)
  3. Spec Review
  4. Ready for development
  5. Development
  UNIT TESTS (local pass) #TODO how
  LINT #TODO how
  6. Code Review: via pull request, additional product review for GUI etc.
  7. Testing: is everything working?
  8. Deploy
  
  Additional: Every month we do staging - this is testing master. Emphasis is on
	      newly added features.
