##<IDEA> use another metric for finding closest matches in recommendations.
For example, by edit distance Numpy and NumpyTutorial are very far away.
Find a metric that connects them very close!

## !!!!! <AWESOME IDEA> !!!!!
Instead of having a cheatsheet file. How about doing this directly from programs?
When you have a .cpp file, you put a sign for kmcht in a comment and label the part 
of code you want to put into a cheatsheet.
e.g.:

// start(KMCHT) [cpp;certificates;default]
void create_certificates(X509Certificate 2 cert) {
	.. some code
}
// end(KMCHT)


##<IDEA> make colorful outputs in the message box!

##<IDEA>
Warn the user if the current knowledge piece is very similar to an existing
knowledge piece

##<IDEA>
Add a visulization of the cheatsheet taxonomy for easier navigation!

##<TODO>
Test this thing out on realworld cases
